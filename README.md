# 🌩️ QOSMETRE | Cloud & DevOps Enthusiast

Hi! I'm QOSMETRE, a passionate **beginner in Cloud Engineering**

I'm currently learning by building small projects, studying core 
concepts, and exploring the tools used by real-world engineers.

## 🛠️ Currently Learning
- ☁️ **Cloud Platforms**: AWS (EC2, S3, IAM, VPC)
- 🐧 **Linux**: CLI, permissions, shell scripting
- 🐍 **Python**: Automating infrastructure tasks
- ⚙️ **DevOps Tools**: Git, GitHub Actions, Docker, Terraform
- 🧠 **Concepts**: CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code, basic networking

## 📂 Projects
- `aws-beginner-lab`: My first experiments with EC2, S3, and IAM  
- `docker-lamp-stack`: A simple web app in Docker using Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP  
- `terraform-labs`: Testing Terraform to deploy cloud resources (in progress)  
- `cloud-automation-scripts`: Python & Bash scripts to automate common tasks  

> 🔄 I believe in **learning by doing**, and I’m constantly updating my projects as I grow.
